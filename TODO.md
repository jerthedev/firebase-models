## üîß Minor Remaining Issues

### Scope Integration Test Issue
**Status**: Minor Issue (1 test failing)
**Priority**: Low

**Issue**: Single test failure in scope integration
- `ScopeIntegrationTest::it_can_bypass_global_scopes_selectively` failing
- Expected 1 result but getting 2 results
- Related to global scope bypass functionality

**Current State**:
- 44/45 scope tests passing (98% pass rate)
- Significant improvement from previous 8 failures
- Core scope functionality working correctly

**Required Fix**:
- Review global scope bypass logic in test
- Verify expected behavior matches implementation

### Cache Test Issue
**Status**: Minor Issue (1 test failing)
**Priority**: Low

**Issue**: Single test failure in cache system
- `CacheableTraitTest::it_can_clear_cache_for_specific_operations` failing
- Cache clear functionality not working as expected
- Related to cache invalidation logic

**Current State**:
- 17/18 cache tests passing (94% pass rate)
- Major cache issues resolved
- Core caching functionality working correctly

**Required Fix**:
- Review cache clear implementation
- Verify cache invalidation logic

### Memory Optimization Test Issue
**Status**: Minor Issue (1 test failing)
**Priority**: Low

**Issue**: Single test failure in memory optimization
- `MemoryOptimizationTest::it_clears_Laravel_service_bindings` failing
- Service binding cleanup not working as expected
- Related to mock cleanup process

**Current State**:
- 5/6 memory tests passing (83% pass rate)
- Major memory issues resolved
- Memory optimization working correctly

**Required Fix**:
- Review service binding cleanup logic
- Verify mock cleanup process

## ÔøΩ Test Migration Status

### Completed Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- **New Test Organization**: Complete three-tier test suite system implemented
- **Mock System Redesign**: Complete with Ultra-Light, Lightweight, and Full mock types
- **Test Utilities**: TestDataFactory and TestConfigManager implemented
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive testing guides and troubleshooting documentation

### Migration Progress
**Status**: Infrastructure Complete, Migration In Progress
**Reference**: See `TEST_MIGRATION.md` for detailed migration plan

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Test suite base classes (UnitTestSuite, IntegrationTestSuite, PerformanceTestSuite)
- ‚úÖ Test utilities and factories
- ‚úÖ Example migration: DeleteOperationsTest.php ‚Üí DeleteOperationsMigrated.php
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive migration documentation

**Remaining Work**:
- 24 test files still need migration to new structure
- Legacy test cleanup after migration
- Configuration updates for new test organization

**Benefits of Migration**:
- 60% reduction in code duplication (demonstrated in example)
- Memory-efficient testing with automatic optimization
- Standardized test patterns and data generation
- Performance monitoring and benchmarking

**Next Steps**:
1. Continue migrating high-priority test files using established pattern
2. Follow migration checklist in `TEST_MIGRATION.md`
3. Remove legacy test files after verification
4. Update CI/CD configuration for new test structure
